# Unsupervised clustering models with cancer data
## By: Owen Yoo, Cassi Hung, Clara Craiu


### Abstract

Multiplex imaging (MI) is a recent technology that enables the visualization of tumor microenvironments (TMEs) by identifying and labeling the types of cells within a tissue. This technology has raised many questions regarding the spatial patterns of cell types within TMEs and their possible relationships with patient characteristics and outcomes. In particular, spatial biomarkers of cell clustering can be quantified using Ripleyâ€™s K function. Using data from the VectraPolarisData package containing multiplex imaging data for 153 lung cancer patients, we used unsupervised machine-learning methods to cluster patients based on their spatial biomarkers. We then visualized the association between these clusters and patient metadata, using survival analysis to distinguish differences in recurrence probability per cluster.
